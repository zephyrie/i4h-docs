# Isaac for Healthcare - Asset Catalog

The Isaac for Healthcare (i4h) asset catalog is a collection of assets that are used to create the i4h simulation environment.

## Asset Categories

The i4h asset catalog contains several categories of assets that are essential for creating realistic healthcare simulations:

### Pre-trained Models
- **Medical Imaging Models**: Deep learning models trained for medical image analysis, segmentation, and diagnosis
- **Surgical Planning Models**: AI models for surgical procedure planning and optimization
- **Patient-specific Models**: Models trained on patient data for personalized healthcare applications

### Simulation-Ready Robots
- **Surgical Robots**: Detailed 3D models of surgical robotic systems with accurate kinematics and dynamics
- **Medical Assist Robots**: Models of robots used for patient assistance and care
- **Lab Automation Robots**: Models of robots used in laboratory settings

### Anatomical Models
- **Standard Anatomy**: High-fidelity 3D models of human anatomy for general simulation
- **Pathological Models**: Models representing various disease states and conditions
- **BYO (Bring Your Own) Anatomy**: Support for importing custom anatomical models with proper documentation and validation guidelines

### Visual Assets
- **Medical Equipment**: 3D models of medical devices and equipment
- **Hospital Environment**: Models of hospital rooms, operating theaters, and medical facilities
- **Materials and Textures**: High-quality textures and materials for realistic rendering

### Configuration Files
- **Simulation Parameters**: Configuration files for physics, rendering, and simulation settings
- **Workflow Templates**: Pre-configured workflow templates for common medical procedures
- **Environment Setups**: Configuration files for different simulation environments

## Asset Documentation
Each asset category includes detailed documentation, usage guidelines, and compatibility information to ensure proper integration into the i4h simulation environment.
