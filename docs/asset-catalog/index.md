# Asset Catalog

Sim-ready medical assets for rapid prototyping and development. The Asset Catalog provides pre-validated 3D models, anatomical structures, and synthetic data generation pipelines for healthcare robotics applications.

## What is the Asset Catalog?

The Asset Catalog is a comprehensive library of medical and surgical assets optimized for simulation and AI training. Each asset is:

- :material-ruler: **Physically Accurate**: Validated material properties and dynamics
- :material-speedometer: **Sim-Ready**: Optimized for real-time simulation performance
- :material-tag-multiple: **Versioned**: Consistent quality with semantic versioning
- :material-puzzle: **Modular**: Mix and match components for custom scenarios
- :material-check-decagram: **Production-Tested**: Used in real healthcare robotics deployments
