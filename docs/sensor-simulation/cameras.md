# Camera & Depth Sensors

Isaac for Healthcare leverages Isaac Sim's comprehensive camera sensor simulation capabilities to provide photorealistic RGB and depth sensing for medical robotics applications.

## Overview

Camera sensors are fundamental to many healthcare robotics applications, from surgical guidance systems to autonomous navigation in hospital environments. Isaac Sim provides physics-based camera simulation with support for:

- **Multiple Camera Models**: Pinhole, fisheye, and custom distortion models
- **Calibration Support**: Direct integration with OpenCV and ROS calibration parameters
- **Multi-sensor Rigs**: Simulate complex camera arrays and depth sensors like Intel RealSense
- **Real-time Performance**: GPU-accelerated rendering for synthetic data generation

## Key Features for Healthcare Applications

- **Surgical Vision Systems**: Simulate endoscopes, microscopes, and multi-view surgical cameras
- **Depth Sensing**: Generate accurate depth maps for robotic navigation and collision avoidance
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combine RGB, depth, and other modalities for robust perception
- **Synthetic Data**: Generate training data with perfect ground truth annotations
