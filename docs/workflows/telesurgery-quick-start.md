## System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- Ubuntu 22.04
- NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 8.6 and 32GB of memory
   - GPUs without RT Cores, such as A100 and H100, are not supported
- 50GB of disk space

### Software Requirements
- NVIDIA Driver Version >= 555
- CUDA Version >= 12.6
- Python 3.10
- RTI DDS License

## Quick Start

### x86 & AARCH64 (IGX) Setup

1. **Set up a Docker environment with CUDA enabled (IGX only):**
   ```bash
   cd <path-to-i4h-workflows>
   xhost +
   workflows/telesurgery/docker/setup.sh run

   # Inside Docker
   workflows/telesurgery/docker/setup.sh init
   ```

2. **Set up the x86 environment with CUDA enabled:**
   ```bash
   cd <path-to-i4h-workflows>
   xhost +
   workflows/telesurgery/docker/setup.sh init
   ```

3. **Create and activate a [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install#quickstart-install-instructions) environment:**
   ```bash
   source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate
   conda create -n telesurgery python=3.10 -y
   conda activate telesurgery
   ```

4. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   cd <path-to-i4h-workflows>
   bash tools/env_setup_telesurgery.sh
   ```

> Make sure your public key is added to the github account if the git authentication fails.

### Obtain RTI DDS License

RTI DDS is the communication package used by all scripts. Please refer to the [DDS website](https://www.rti.com/products) for registration. You will need to obtain a license file and set the `RTI_LICENSE_FILE` environment variable to its path.

### NTP Server (Optional)

An NTP (Network Time Protocol) server provides accurate time information to clients over a computer network. NTP is designed to synchronize the clocks of computers to a reference time source, ensuring all devices on the network maintain the same time.

```bash
# Run your own NTP server in the background
docker run -d --name ntp-server --restart=always -p 123:123/udp cturra/ntp

# Check if it's running
docker logs ntp-server

# fix server ip in env.sh for NTP Server
export NTP_SERVER_HOST=<NTP server address>

# To stop the server
# docker stop ntp-server && docker rm ntp-server
```

### Environment Variables

Before running any scripts, set up the following environment variables:

1. **PYTHONPATH**: Set this to point to the **scripts** directory:
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH=<path-to-i4h-workflows>/workflows/telesurgery/scripts
   ```
   This ensures Python can find the modules under the [`scripts`](./scripts) directory.

2. **RTI_LICENSE_FILE**: Set this to point to your RTI DDS license file:
   ```bash
   export RTI_LICENSE_FILE=<path-to-rti-license-file>
   ```
   This is required for the DDS communication package to function properly.

3. **NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS**: Set this to the IP address receiving camera data:
   ```bash
   export NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS="surgeon IP address"
   ```
More recommended variables can be found in [env.sh](./scripts/env.sh).

## Running the Workflow

```bash
cd <path-to-i4h-workflows>/workflows/telesurgery/scripts
source env.sh  # Make sure all env variables are correctly set in env.sh

export PATIENT_IP=<patient IP address>
export SURGEON_IP=<surgeon IP address>
```
> Make sure the MIRA API Server is up and running (port: 8081) in the case of a physical world setup.

### [Option 1] Patient in Physical World _(x86 / aarch64)_

When running on IGX (aarch64), ensure you are in the Docker environment set up previously.

```bash
# Stream camera output
python patient/physical/camera.py --camera realsense --name room --width 1280 --height 720
python patient/physical/camera.py --camera cv2 --name robot --width 1920 --height 1080
```

### [Option 2] Patient in Simulation World _(x86)_

```bash
# Download the assets
i4h-asset-retrieve

python patient/simulation/main.py [--encoder nvc]
```

### Surgeon Connecting to Patient _(x86 / aarch64)_

```bash
# capture robot camera stream
NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS=${PATIENT_IP} python surgeon/camera.py --name robot --width 1280 --height 720 [--decoder nvc]

# capture room camera stream (optional)
NDDS_DISCOVERY_PEERS=${PATIENT_IP} python surgeon/camera.py --name room --width 1280 --height 720 [--decoder nvc]

# Connect to gamepad controller and send commands to API Server
python surgeon/gamepad.py --api_host ${PATIENT_IP} --api_port 8081
```

### Using H.264/HEVC Encoder/Decoder from NVIDIA Video Codec

Camera data can be streamed using either the H.264 or HEVC (H.265) codecs. To enable this for the Patient and Surgeon applications, use the `--encoder nvc` or `--decoder nvc` argument, respectively.

Encoding parameters can be customized in the Patient application using the `--encoder_params` argument, as shown below:

```bash
python patient/simulation/main.py --encoder nvc --encoder_params patient/nvc_encoder_params.json
```

#### Sample Encoding Parameters for the NVIDIA Video Codec

Here's an example of encoding parameters in JSON format:

```json
{
    "codec": "H264", // Possible values: H264 or HEVC
    "preset": "P3", // Options include P3, P4, P5, P6, P7
    "bitrate": 10000000,
    "frame_rate": 60,
    "rate_control_mode": 1, // Options: 0 for Constant QP, 1 for Variable bitrate, 2 for Constant bitrate
    "multi_pass_encoding": 0 // Options: 0 to disable, 1 for Quarter resolution, 2 for Full resolution
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> H.264 or HEVC (H.265) codecs are available on x86 platform only.

### Important Notes
1. You may need to run multiple scripts simultaneously in different terminals or run in background (in case of docker)
2. A typical setup requires multiple terminals running:
   - Patient: Camera1, Camera2, Controller, etc.
   - Surgeon: Camera1, Camera2, Controller, etc.

If you encounter issues not covered in the notes above, please check the documentation for each component or open a new issue on GitHub.
