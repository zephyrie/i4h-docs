## Installation

Follow the [Environment Setup](../../README.md#environment-setup) instructions to setup the environment and dependencies.

## Environments

Isaac-Lab scripts usually receive a `--task <task_name>` argument. This argument is used to select the environment/task to be run.
These tasks are detected by the `gym.register` function in the [exts/robotic_us_ext/__init__.py](exts/robotic_us_ext/robotic_us_ext/tasks/ultrasound/approach/config/franka/__init__.py).

These registered tasks are then further defined in the [environment configuration file](exts/robotic_us_ext/robotic_us_ext/tasks/ultrasound/approach/config/franka/franka_manager_rl_env_cfg.py).

Available tasks:
- `Isaac-Teleop-Torso-FrankaUsRs-IK-RL-Rel-v0`: FrankaUsRs with relative actions
- `Isaac-Reach-Torso-FrankaUsRs-IK-RL-Abs-v0` : FrankaUsRs with absolute actions

Currently there are these robot configurations that can be used in various tasks


| Robot name                                 | task             | applications          |
|----------                                  |---------         |----------             |
| FRANKA_PANDA_REALSENSE_ULTRASOUND_CFG      | \*-FrankaUsRs-*  | Reach, Teleop         |

## Apps

### PI Zero Policy Evaluation
Set up `openpi` referring to [PI0 runner](../policy_runner/README.md).

#### Ensure the PYTHONPATH Is Set

Please refer to the [Environment Setup - Set environment variables before running the scripts](../../README.md#set-environment-variables-before-running-the-scripts) instructions.

#### Run the script

Please move to the current [`simulation` folder](./) and execute:

```sh
python imitation_learning/pi0_policy/eval.py --enable_camera
```

NOTE: You can also specify `--ckpt_path` to run a specific policy.
This should open a stage with Franka arm and run the robotic ultrasound actions:
![pi0 simulation](../../assets/images/pi0_sim.jpg)

### Policy Evaluation w/ DDS
This example should work together with the `pi0 policy runner` via DDS communication,
so please ensure to launch the `run_policy.py` with `height=224`, `width=224`,
and the same `domain id` as this example in another terminal.

When `run_policy.py` is launched and idle waiting for the data,

#### Ensure the PYTHONPATH Is Set

Please refer to the [Environment Setup - Set environment variables before running the scripts](../../README.md#set-environment-variables-before-running-the-scripts) instructions.

#### Run the script

Please move to the current [`simulation` folder](./) and execute:

```sh
python environments/sim_with_dds.py --enable_cameras
```

#### Evaluating with Recorded Initial States and Saving Trajectories

The `sim_with_dds.py` script can also be used for more controlled evaluations by resetting the environment to initial states from recorded HDF5 data. When doing so, it can save the resulting end-effector trajectories.

- **`--hdf5_path /path/to/your/data.hdf5`**: Provide the path to an HDF5 file (or a directory containing HDF5 files for multiple episodes). The simulation will reset the environment to the initial state(s) found in this data for each episode.
- **`--npz_prefix your_prefix_`**: When `--hdf5_path` is used, this argument specifies a prefix for the names of the `.npz` files where the simulated end-effector trajectories will be saved. Each saved file will be named like `your_prefix_robot_obs_{episode_idx}.npz` and stored in the same directory as the input HDF5 file (if `--hdf5_path` is a file) or within the `--hdf5_path` directory (if it's a directory).

**Example:**

```sh
python environments/sim_with_dds.py \
    --enable_cameras \
    --hdf5_path /mnt/hdd/cosmos/heldout-test50/data_0.hdf5 \
    --npz_prefix pi0-800_
```

This command will load the initial state from `data_0.hdf5`, run the simulation (presumably interacting with a policy via DDS), and save the resulting trajectory to a file like `pi0-800_robot_obs_0.npz` in the `/mnt/hdd/cosmos/heldout-test50/` directory.

### Liver Scan State Machine

The Liver Scan State Machine provides a structured approach to performing ultrasound scans on a simulated liver. It implements a state-based workflow that guides the robotic arm through the scanning procedure.

#### Overview

The state machine transitions through the following states:
- **SETUP**: Initial positioning of the robot
- **APPROACH**: Moving toward the organ
- **CONTACT**: Making contact with the organ surface
- **SCANNING**: Performing the ultrasound scan
- **DONE**: Completing the scan procedure

The state machine integrates multiple control modules:
- **Force Control**: Manages contact forces during scanning
- **Orientation Control**: Maintains proper probe orientation
- **Path Planning**: Guides the robot through the scanning trajectory

#### Requirements

- This implementation works **only with a single environment** (`--num_envs 1`).
- It should be used with the `Isaac-Teleop-Torso-FrankaUsRs-IK-RL-Rel-v0` environment.

#### Usage

Please refer to the [Environment Setup - Set environment variables before running the scripts](../../README.md#set-environment-variables-before-running-the-scripts) to set the `PYTHONPATH`.

Then please move to the current [`simulation` folder](./) and execute:

```sh
python environments/state_machine/liver_scan_sm.py --enable_cameras
```

#### Data Collection

To run the state machine and collect data for a specified number of episodes, you need to pass the `--num_episodes` argument. Default is 0, which means no data collection.

```sh
python environments/state_machine/liver_scan_sm.py \
    --enable_camera \
    --num_episodes 2
```

This will collect data for 2 complete episodes and store it in HDF5 format.

#### Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--task` | str | None | Name of the task (environment) to use |
| `--num_episodes` | int | 0 | Number of episodes to collect data for (0 = no data collection) |
| `--camera_names` | list[str] | ["room_camera", "wrist_camera"] | List of camera names to capture images from |
| `--disable_fabric` | flag | False | Disable fabric and use USD I/O operations |
| `--num_envs` | int | 1 | Number of environments to spawn (must be 1 for this script) |
| `--reset_steps` | int | 40 | Number of steps to take during environment reset |
| `--max_steps` | int | 350 | Maximum number of steps before forcing a reset |
| `--include_seg` | bool | True | Whether to include semantic segmentation in the data collection |

> **Note:** It is recommended to use at least 40 steps for `--reset_steps` to allow enough steps for the robot to properly reset to the SETUP position.

#### Data Collection Details

When data collection is enabled (`--num_episodes > 0`), the state machine will:

1. Create a timestamped directory in `./data/hdf5/` to store the collected data
2. Record observations, actions, and state information at each step
3. Capture RGB and depth images from the specified cameras
4. Store all data in HDF5 format compatible with robomimic

The collected data includes:
- Robot observations (position, orientation)
- Torso observations (organ position, orientation)
- Relative and absolute actions
- State machine state
- Joint positions
- Camera images (RGB, depth, segmentation if `--include_seg` is enabled)


#### Keyboard Controls

During execution, you can press the 'r' key to reset the environment and state machine.

### Replay Recorded Trajectories

The `replay_recording.py` script allows you to visualize previously recorded HDF5 trajectories in the Isaac Sim environment. It loads recorded actions, organ positions, and robot joint states from HDF5 files for each episode and steps through them in the simulation.

#### Usage

Ensure your `PYTHONPATH` is set up as described in the [Environment Setup - Set environment variables before running the scripts](../../README.md#set-environment-variables-before-running-the-scripts).

Navigate to the [`simulation` folder](./) and execute:

```sh
python environments/state_machine/replay_recording.py --hdf5_path /path/to/your/hdf5_data_directory --task <YourTaskName>
```

Replace `/path/to/your/hdf5_data_directory` with the actual path to the directory containing your `data_*.hdf5` files or single HDF5 file, and `<YourTaskName>` with the task name used during data collection (e.g., `Isaac-Teleop-Torso-FrankaUsRs-IK-RL-Rel-v0`).

| `--disable_fabric` | flag | `False`                                  | Disable fabric and use USD I/O operations.                                       |

> **Note:** Additional common Isaac Lab arguments (like `--device`) can also be used.


### Cosmos-transfer1 Integration

[Cosmos-Transfer1](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer1) is a world-to-world transfer model designed to bridge the perceptual divide between simulated and real-world environments.
We introduce a training-free guided generation method on top of Cosmos-Transfer1 to overcome unsatisfactory results on unseen healthcare simulation assets.
Directly applying Cosmos-Transfer with various control inputs results in unsatisfactory outputs for the human phantom and robotic arm (see bottom figure). In contrast, our guided generation method preserves the appearance of the phantom and robotic arm while generating diverse backgrounds.
<img src="/assets/images/cosmos_transfer_result.png" width="512" height="600" />

This training-free guided generation approach by encoding simulation videos into the latent space and applying spatial masking to guide the generation process. The trade-off between realism and faithfulness can be controlled by adjusting the number of guided denoising steps. In addition, our generation pipeline supports multi-view video generation. We first leverage the camera information to warp the generated room view to wrist view, then use it as the guidance of wrist-view generation.

#### Download Cosmos-transfer1 Checkpoints
Please install cosmos-transfer1 dependency and move to the third party `cosmos-transfer1` folder. The following command downloads the checkpoints:
```sh
conda activate cosmos-transfer1
CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python scripts/download_checkpoints.py --output_dir checkpoints/
```
#### Video Prompt Generation
We follow the idea in [lucidsim](https://github.com/lucidsim/lucidsim) to first generate batches of meta prompt that contains a very concise description of the potential scene, then instruct the LLM (e.g., [gemma-3-27b-it](https://build.nvidia.com/google/gemma-3-27b-it)) to upsample the meta prompt with detailed descriptions.
We provide example prompts in [`generated_prompts_two_seperate_views.json`](./environments/cosmos_transfer1/config/generated_prompts_two_seperate_views.json).

#### Running Cosmos-transfer1 + Guided Generation
Please move to the current [`simulation` folder](./) and execute the following command to start the generation pipeline:
```sh
export CHECKPOINT_DIR="path to downloaded cosmos-transfer1 checkpoints"
# Set project root path
export PROJECT_ROOT="{your path}/i4h-workflows"
# Set PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH="$PROJECT_ROOT/third_party/cosmos-transfer1:$PROJECT_ROOT/workflows/robotic_ultrasound/scripts"
# run bath inference for generation pipeline
CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH python \
    -m environments.cosmos_transfer1.transfer \
    --checkpoint_dir $CHECKPOINT_DIR \
    --source_data_dir "Path to source dir of h5 files" \
    --output_data_dir "Path to output dir of h5 files" \

#### Hand Tracking Controls

Please review the [Hand Tracking Teleoperation Tutorial](../../../../tutorials/assets/bring_your_own_xr/README.md) for
details on Isaac Lab XR hand tracking support and setup instructions.

#### Camera Visualization

The teleoperation script supports real-time camera visualization through DDS communication. It publishes both room camera and wrist camera feeds at 30Hz.

The camera feeds are published on the following default topics:
- Room camera: `topic_room_camera_data_rgb`
- Wrist camera: `topic_wrist_camera_data_rgb`

Both cameras output 224x224 RGB images that can be visualized using compatible DDS subscribers.

#### Ultrasound Image Visualization

The teleoperation script also supports real-time ultrasound image visualization through DDS communication. It publishes the ultrasound image at 30Hz.

Please refer to the [Ultrasound Raytracing Simulation](#ultrasound-raytracing-simulation) section for more details on how to visualize the ultrasound image.


### Ultrasound Raytracing Simulation

This example implements a standalone ultrasound raytracing simulator that generates realistic ultrasound images
based on 3D meshes. The simulator uses Holoscan framework and DDS communication for realistic performance.

#### NVIDIA OptiX Raytracing with Python Bindings

For instructions on preparing and building the Python module, please refer to the [Environment Setup](../../README.md#install-the-raytracing-ultrasound-simulator) instructions and [Ultrasound Raytracing README](https://github.com/isaac-for-healthcare/i4h-sensor-simulation/blob/v0.2.0rc1/ultrasound-raytracing/README.md) to setup the `raysim` module correctly.


#### Configuration

Optionally, the simulator supports customization through JSON configuration files. You need to create your configuration file following the structure below:

```json
{
    "probe_type": "curvilinear",
    "probe_params": {
