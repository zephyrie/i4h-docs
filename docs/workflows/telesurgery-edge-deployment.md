# Edge Deployment (Holoscan/IGX)

!!! error "Documentation Incomplete"
    The current holohub README only contains a brief description. Complete edge deployment documentation is needed.
    
    **Current README location**: `i4h-workflows/workflows/telesurgery/scripts/holohub/README.md`
    
    The README needs to be expanded to include:
    - Holoscan operator development guide for telesurgery
    - Docker containerization instructions
    - IGX deployment specifics
    - Performance optimization for edge devices
    - Clinical integration guidelines
    - Real-time performance requirements
    - Hardware acceleration setup
    - Operator pipeline configuration
    - Resource management on edge devices
    - Monitoring and diagnostics
    
    Currently it only contains: "This folder contains Holoscan related operators and applications for telesurgery."

## Placeholder Content

This page is a placeholder for complete edge deployment documentation. The existing README at the location above needs significant expansion to cover all requirements for deploying telesurgery on edge devices.
