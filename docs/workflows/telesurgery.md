# Telesurgery

Remote surgical operation with ultra-low latency streaming, haptic feedback, and real-time robot control.

## Overview

The telesurgery workflow enables surgeons to perform procedures remotely through high-fidelity video streaming and precise robotic control. This framework provides:

- Ultra-low latency video streaming with H.264/HEVC encoding
- Real-time bilateral control with haptic feedback
- Multi-camera surgical views with depth perception
- Secure DDS-based communication for patient safety

Supports both physical and simulated environments, enabling training, collaboration, and remote surgical care.
