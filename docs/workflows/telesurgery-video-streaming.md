# Video Streaming Configuration

!!! error "Documentation Missing"
    This documentation needs to be created by the engineering team.
    
    **Required README location**: `i4h-workflows/workflows/telesurgery/scripts/holohub/operators/nvidia_video_codec/README.md`
    
    The README should include:
    - Detailed codec selection guide (H.264 vs HEVC)
    - Performance tuning for different network conditions
    - Multi-camera synchronization
    - Camera stream merging/splitting utilities
    - Adaptive bitrate algorithms
    - Latency optimization techniques
    - GPU utilization best practices
    - Integration with DDS transport
    - Quality vs latency tradeoffs
    - Troubleshooting guide

## Placeholder Content

This page is a placeholder for video streaming documentation. Once the README is created at the location above, this page will be automatically synchronized with its content.
