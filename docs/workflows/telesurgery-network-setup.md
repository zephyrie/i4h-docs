# Network & Communication Setup

!!! error "Documentation Incomplete"
    The current DDS README only contains troubleshooting information. Complete network setup documentation is needed.
    
    **Current README location**: `i4h-workflows/workflows/telesurgery/scripts/dds/README.md`
    
    The README needs to be expanded to include:
    - Complete DDS configuration guide
    - RTI license setup instructions
    - QoS profiles for video and control data
    - Domain configuration
    - Security setup (authentication, encryption)
    - Time synchronization (NTP/PTP)
    - Multi-NIC configuration
    - Firewall requirements
    - Bandwidth requirements
    - Latency optimization
    
    Currently it only contains troubleshooting and discovery diagnostics.

## Placeholder Content

This page is a placeholder for complete network setup documentation. The existing README at the location above needs significant expansion to cover all network configuration requirements for telesurgery.
