## Troubleshooting DDS Communication

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Connection Problems**:
  - Ensure your RTI license is properly installed and valid
  - Verify the environment variable `RTI_LICENSE_FILE` points to the correct license file location

- **Topic Discovery Issues**:
  - Confirm that QoS (Quality of Service) settings match between publishers and subscribers
  - Ensure domain IDs are consistent across all communicating applications
  - Try increasing the discovery wait time in your application

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - For high-frequency topics (like camera feeds), adjust history depth to prevent buffer overflow
  - Consider using BEST_EFFORT reliability for streaming data where occasional packet loss is acceptable
  - Monitor resource usage and adjust queue sizes accordingly

For comprehensive troubleshooting guidance, refer to the [RTI Connext DDS Getting Started Guide](https://www.rti.com/gettingstarted).

## RTI DDS Schemas

### Overview

The [`schemas`](https://github.com/isaac-for-healthcare/i4h-workflows/tree/main/workflows/robotic_ultrasound/scripts/dds/schemas) directory contains auto-generated schema files created from IDL (Interface Definition Language) definitions for the RTI DDS (Data Distribution Service) implementation used in the robotic ultrasound workflow.

### Important Notes

- **Auto-generated Content**: The schema files in this directory are automatically generated by the RTI IDL compiler. Do not modify these files directly unless absolutely necessary.

- **Regeneration Process**: If changes to the data structures are required, modify the original IDL files and regenerate the schemas using the RTI IDL compiler. The typical command is:
  ```
  rtiddsgen -language <target_language> -d <output_dir> <input_idl_file>
  ```
