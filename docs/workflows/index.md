# Workflows

Complete end-to-end healthcare robotics applications that combine simulation, training, and deployment. Workflows provide production-ready implementations that integrate all aspects of the Isaac for Healthcare platform.

## What are Workflows?

Workflows are pre-built, modular robotics applications that demonstrate the full development journey from simulation to deployment. Each workflow includes:

- **Complete Implementation**: Full source code with simulation environments
- **Pre-trained Policies**: AI models ready for deployment or fine-tuning
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Benchmarks and validation tools
- **Hardware Integration**: Recipes for connecting to real robots and sensors
- **Deployment Guides**: Instructions for edge deployment with Holoscan

## Extend the Platform

Isaac for Healthcare is designed to be extensible. Bring your own assets and hardware:

**Custom Assets:**

- [Bring Your Own Patient](../how-to/how-to-bring-your-own-patient.md) - Convert medical imaging to simulation
- [Bring Your Own Robot](../how-to/how-to-bring-your-own-robot.md) - Integrate custom platforms
- [Bring Your Own XR](../how-to/how-to-bring-your-own-xr.md) - Mixed reality devices

These guides show how to extend any workflow with your own patients, robots, and interaction devices.
