# Workflows

Complete end-to-end healthcare robotics applications that combine simulation, training, and deployment. Workflows provide production-ready implementations that integrate all aspects of the Isaac for Healthcare platform.

## What are Workflows?

Workflows are pre-built, modular robotics applications that demonstrate the full development journey from simulation to deployment. Each workflow includes:

- **Complete Implementation**: Full source code with simulation environments
- **Pre-trained Policies**: AI models ready for deployment or fine-tuning
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Benchmarks and validation tools
- **Hardware Integration**: Recipes for connecting to real robots and sensors
- **Deployment Guides**: Instructions for edge deployment with Holoscan
