## System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- Ubuntu 22.04
- NVIDIA GPU with ray tracing capability
    - GPUs without RT Cores (A100, H100) are not supported
    - Minimum 8GB VRAM recommended
- 50GB of disk space
- 16GB RAM minimum

### Software Requirements
- NVIDIA Driver Version >= 555
- Python 3.10

## Quick Start

1. Install NVIDIA driver (>= 555)
2. Create and activate conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n robotic_surgery python=3.10 -y
   conda activate robotic_surgery
   ```
3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   cd <path-to-i4h-workflows>
   bash tools/env_setup_robot_surgery.sh
   ```
4. Download assets:
   ```bash
   i4h-asset-retrieve
   ```
5. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH=<path-to-i4h-workflows>/workflows/robotic_surgery/scripts
   ```

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

The robotic surgery workflow is built on the following dependencies:
- [IsaacSim 4.5.0](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/4.5.0/index.html)
- [IsaacLab 2.1.0](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/v2.1.0/index.html)

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Install NVIDIA Driver
Install or upgrade to the latest NVIDIA driver from [NVIDIA website](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/)

**Note**: The workflow requires driver version >= 555 for ray tracing capabilities.

#### 2. Install Dependencies

##### Create Conda Environment
```bash
# Create a new conda environment
conda create -n robotic_surgery python=3.10 -y
# Activate the environment
conda activate robotic_surgery
```

##### Install All Dependencies
The main script `tools/env_setup_robot_surgery.sh` installs all necessary dependencies:

###### Base Components
- IsaacSim 4.5.0 (and core dependencies)
- IsaacLab 2.1.0
- Essential build tools and libraries

Run the script from the repository root:
```bash
cd <path-to-i4h-workflows>
bash tools/env_setup_robot_surgery.sh
```

### Asset Setup

Download the required assets using:
```bash
i4h-asset-retrieve
```

This will download assets to `~/.cache/i4h-assets/<sha256>`. For more details, refer to the [Asset Container Helper](https://github.com/isaac-for-healthcare/i4h-asset-catalog/blob/v0.2.0rc1/docs/catalog_helper.md).

### Environment Variables

Before running any scripts, you need to set up the following environment variables:

1. **PYTHONPATH**: Set this to point to the scripts directory:
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH=<path-to-i4h-workflows>/workflows/robotic_surgery/scripts
   ```
   This ensures Python can find the modules under the [`scripts`](./scripts) directory.

## Running the Workflow

The robotic surgery workflow provides several example scripts demonstrating different components:

- [Simulation](./scripts/simulation)
  - Basic robot control
  - Surgical task simulation
  - State machine demonstrations
  - Reinforcement learning examples
