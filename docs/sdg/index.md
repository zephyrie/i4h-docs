# SDG Capabilities

Synthetic data generation capabilities for training robust AI models. Create unlimited, diverse datasets for medical robotics validation without compromising patient privacy or safety.

## What is SDG?

Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) capabilities provide powerful tools for creating high-quality training data for medical AI applications. Generate photorealistic medical imaging data, procedural scenarios, and anatomical variations to train more robust and generalizable models.

**Key Benefits:**

- :material-infinity: **Unlimited Data**: Generate diverse datasets without patient involvement
- :material-shield-lock: **Privacy Compliant**: HIPAA-compliant synthetic data generation
- :material-cash-minus: **Cost Effective**: Reduce data collection and annotation costs
- :material-target: **Ground Truth**: Perfect labels and annotations for every sample
- :material-chart-scatter-plot: **Edge Cases**: Safely simulate rare or dangerous scenarios
