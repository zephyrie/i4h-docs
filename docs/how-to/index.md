# How-to Guides

Practical, task-focused tutorials for Isaac for Healthcare. Each guide provides step-by-step instructions for accomplishing specific goals.

## What are How-to Guides?

How-to guides are recipe-like instructions that help you complete specific tasks. Unlike the complete end-to-end [Workflows](../workflows/index.md), these guides focus on individual components and techniques that you can mix and match based on your needs.

**Use these guides when you want to:**

- Learn a specific technique or tool
- Solve a particular problem
- Understand individual components before combining them
- Customize existing workflows with your own approaches
