# Configure Surgery State Machines

!!! error "Documentation Missing"
    This documentation needs to be created by the engineering team.
    
    **Required README location**: `i4h-workflows/workflows/robotic_surgery/scripts/simulation/scripts/environments/state_machine/README.md`
    
    The README should include:
    - State machine architecture overview
    - How to create custom state machines
    - State definition and transition rules
    - Error handling and recovery states
    - Integration with surgical tasks
    - Best practices for surgical state machines
    - Debugging and visualization tools
    - Example state machine implementations
    - Safety considerations
    - Performance optimization

## Placeholder Content

This page is a placeholder for surgery state machine configuration documentation. Once the README is created at the location above, this page will be automatically synchronized with its content.

## Current Resources

For basic state machine examples, see:
- [Surgical Tasks](/workflows/robotic-surgery/surgical-tasks/) - Contains examples of state machine implementations
- [Robotic Surgery Overview](/workflows/robotic-surgery/) - General workflow information
